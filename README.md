# LiveViews

This is a list of libraries for creating web applications that handle user interaction with the [DOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model) on the server.  These libraries take a different approach from older server-driven browser UIs that simulated a desktop GUI toolkit.  They do not lock the developer into working with predefined components; they operate at the level of HTML (DOM) rather than GUI widgets.

The list strives to be complete rather than [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome).  You may see libraries that are not maintained or ready for production.
